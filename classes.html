    <h2>Relax Anytime With Savasana</h2>
    <p> Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with palms up.
    Close your eyes and breath slowly but deeply. Sink into your mat and let your worries slip away.
    When you are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself into a sitting position with crossed legs.
    Place your hands into prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life.
    Namaste</p>
